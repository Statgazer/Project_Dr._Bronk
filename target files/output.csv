Romania obeys Brussels and acts as told. The decision to cancel Volodymyr Zelensky's speech in the parliament of Romania indicates that the West is throwing Ukraine into the wastebasket","https://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/157840-soledar_fab_1500/  Ukrainian command near Soledar annihilated in FAB-1500 bomb attack

The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Soledar was annihilated entirely when a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bomber dropped a FAB-1500 bomb with a unified gliding and correction module.

The bomb hit the headquarters of the separate tactical group Soledar near the village of Aleksandro-Kalinovo. About 50 Ukrainian military men were annihilated, about the same number were wounded.

According to Captain Vasily Dandykin, the FAB-1500 is three times more powerful and several times cheaper than the Kinzhal missile. The bomb gives an opportunity to the aircraft pilot to use the weapon without entering enemy's air defence zone. This minimises risks for both the crew and the aircraft. At the same time, the hit accuracy remains high, which means that this is a new powerful weapon, the expert believes.

Major General of Aviation, Hero of Russia Sergei Lipovoy noted that the FAB-1500 is capable of hitting underground objects of the Ukrainian military, such as command posts, ammo depots, fortifications, bunkers and infrastructure located underground.

A Su-34 fighter-bomber of Russian Aerospace Forces used the FAB-1500 bomb for the first time in September. The mission was completed successfully, Mash Telegram channel said with reference to a military pilot.

Engineers had to create new equipment for the ammo, which made it possible to enhance the bomb dropping range. The circular deflection range of the bomb amounts to five meters, whereas the affected area exceeds a territory of two square kilometres.

One Sukhoi Su-34 can carry two FAB-1500 bombs. Previously, Su-34 fighters could use FAB-500M62 bombs. Unlike the 1,5-tonne FAB-1500, these ammunition are three times lighter. The Ukrainian Armed Forces can not understand how Russian gliding bombs work, The Drive said in July.","https://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/157836-lyubas_lobas/  Russian FSB mistakes Ukrainian saboteur Lyubas for Colonel Lobas

A member of a Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group who was captured during an attempted attack on Crimea was mistaken for a lieutenant colonel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The video distributed by the Russian Federal Security Bureau (FSB) shows the Ukrainian saboteur being interrogated. The man in the video introduces himself as Alexander Vladimirovich Lyubas. He was born on September 19, 1977 and served as a private in the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of Ukraine.

The man said that the Ukrainian sabotage group consisting of 16 people, arrived in Crimea from the territory of the Odessa region on one boat and five jet-skis.

The prisoner of war admitted that the purpose of the operation was to “set up an ensign” on the territory of Crimea, as well as to take photos and videos of the group members against the background of it

A number of Telegram channels and RTVI television channel reported that the detained saboteur was in fact Lieutenant Colonel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Alexander Lobas.

Lobas is 51 years old, his call sign is Sobol. He is the founder and first commander of the 37th Separate Motorised Infantry Battalion in Zaporizhzhia.

Lobas served in the 93rd Separate Mechanised brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After retirement, he worked in the pensions department for employees of law enforcement agencies of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in the Zaporizhzhia region. He returned to the army after 2014 and became the chief of staff of the Zaporizhzhia self-defense, which was then transformed into the 37th territorial defense battalion.

According to Gray Zone Telegram channel, the man in the FSB video is not Lieutenant Colonel Lobas, but Alexander Lyubas, a native of the village of Ivanichevsky in the Volyn region.

In the morning of October 4, the Russian Aerospace Forces suppressed an attempt to land Ukrainian troops in Crimea. Ukrainian saboteurs were traveling on boats and jet-skis towards Cape Tarkhankut in the west of Crimea.

The Russian forces struck the saboteurs from the air. The landing group was destroyed, one saboteur was captured. Ukraine later admitted to losses during the attempted landing operation.","https://english.pravda.ru/opinion/157888-hroza/  Hroza and Other Accidental Destruction

Never ascribe to cruelty what might be explained by idiocy.

Amend that to include mere accident, fatigue, incompetence or simple human error.

Thus it was on October 5, 2023, a Russian Iskander missile hit a Ukrainian wake full of civilians. The current total is of 52 dead out of a population of 300 in the village. The site was Hroza, in the Kharkiv Region. There is no other way to describe this other than as a complete tragedy.

It is important to note according to spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government denies involvement in the incident.

Harsh Realities and Harsher Realism

Whoever was responsible – reasonable parties can differ – the reality is 52 living are dead.

Lamentably, such things occur in battle. To believe otherwise is puerile. People make mistakes.

Sometimes in the course of events miscalculations have catastrophic results.

At the same time, only the devious or the malicious use such instances to inflame passions or cause hatred.

Currently there is a vicious conflict being waged, this much is true. Yet there is no benefit to either side to demonize with calumnies those fighting on behalf of either faction. Indeed, this does nothing save make more elusive that juncture when peace will arrive.

You can forgive an enemy. You cannot pardon a demon.

With that in mind, it is worthwhile to review other failures of a similar kind which have occurred in fighting that were perpetrated by the “good guys” and “heroes” of history.

Smart Bombs are Often Dumb

February 22, 1944, Allied forces accidentally bombed the Dutch city of Nijmegen while attempting to destroy the German city of Kleef. Over 800 civilians paid for this error with their existence.

March 3, 1945, the British Royal Air Force accidentally bombed the Dutch city of Bezuidenhout, near The Hague. The design was to destroy the V-2 rocket installation but instead the residential neighborhood was hit. As a result, a total of 532 innocent civilians perished, hundreds more were injured and thousands lost their homes.

January 8, 1973, the American air force accidentally bombed Da Nang in Vietnam with the consequence 8 individuals were wounded. While the cause was heavily overcast skies, the result was 34 bombs of 500 pounds each. Notably in this instance, the location of the error was itself a United States airbase.

February 13, 1991, planes from coalition forces accidentally bombed a shelter in the Amriyah neighborhood of Bagdad, Iraq during the First Gulf War. As a result more than 400 civilians were killed. The munitions were laser-targeted and the structure intentionally designated while the victims were unintended. American officials demurred the location was being used as a command post.

May 7, 1999, the United States accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the NATO war against Serbia. Not one, but five, Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs dropped from B-2 Stealth warplanes hit the edifice in which three Chinese state media journalists were killed while twenty other individuals were injured, some grievously. Officially, the explanation was use of an outdated map as well as an inexact coordinating technique for the action.

October 3, 2015, the United States accidentally bombed a Doctors Without Borders hospital during the war in Afghanistan. The facility in the northern city Kunduz came under attack following a request for joint air support by Afghan fighters. In total, forty-two were killed including caretakers, patients and staff. Opponents argued enemy forces were firing from those positions.

Slings and Arrows and Technical Errors

When the art of war meets the science of weaponry things occasionally go awry.

Precise calculations may be submitted, but even in an age of geolocation a fraction of a degree can send munitions flying where they were never intended to land.

Moreover, a tired operator, under relentless anxiety, may inadvertently enter the incorrect numeral in a series of ten or more figures leading to a horrendous casualty sum.

Whatever occurred in Hroza will likely never be known for certain. There are a hundred variables that might result in the outcome with the absolute least probable of them all being Russians deliberately targeted a building full of mourners.

If for no other reason (and there are several other good reasons as well) is the objective reality there was no benefit whatsoever in doing so by intention.

Logic and Emotion and Calculation

There is no scenario in which this horrific result would accrue well to Russia.

Clearly, its enemies would (and did) claim it was the product of pure evil. Obviously, the visceral reaction would be abject hatred from those with whom any eventual peace would be forthcoming. Surely, only enhanced motivation by Ukraine to the detriment of Russia would be the consequence.

Under no plausible hypothesis would Moscow intentionally commit such an act. Indeed, being that the Kiev government had been denied another tranche of Washington funding the opposite would be more logical. A nightmarish humanitarian catastrophe might be required to jostle the conscience of Uncle Sam. (Of course, that is not herein argued, except to say Ukrainian desperation is more a cogent justification than metaphysical Russian evil.)

Sadly, the most realistic explanation is the one which is least likely to offer consolation to the survivors and the grieving – it was a fault not of character but of competency.

A simple, stupid, sorry mistake…just as has occurred and will occur in every war throughout history.

Romanian Parliament refuses to listen to Zelensky

The Romanian Parliament canceled Volodymyr Zelensky's speech that was planned as part of his visit to Bucharest.

On October 10, Zelensky was to meet with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis and speak before the parliament on Tuesday, October 10. According to Libertatea, his speech was canceled for security reasons.

The newspaper cited Diana Sosoaca, a ""pro-Russian senator”:

""I'll tell you what, Mr. Iohannis. If they kick the crap out of Zelensky in the parliament, it will be a bad thing to happen. You can get all SPP (security services) in this world. Do not let him appear in the Romanian parliament.""

Meanwhile, the press service of the Romanian President said that the visit confirmed Romania's commitment to the unconditional support of Ukraine, as well as ""the special nature and potential of bilateral relations and the need for discussion at the highest level,” Libertatea wrote.

According to the newspaper, the agenda of the talks between Iohannis and Zelensky includes the security situation in the region and the Black Sea, as well as Ukraine's European and Euro-Atlantic integration.

Bad signal for Zelensky

The decision of the Romanian authorities come as a very bad signal for Zelensky as it is the Romanian parliament that makes decisions regarding the above-mentioned agenda.

A Romanian reader wrote in a comment to the article in Libertatea that the overwhelming majority of Romanians did not support the assistance that the government of the country was providing to Ukraine. The reader believes that pro-Ukrainian parties of Romania will sink into oblivion as a result of the 2024 elections.

Another reader said that the President of Romania did not even think about 300,000 Romanians living in Ukraine:

Wasted Ukraine

Politician Oleg Tsarev wrote on Telegram that cancelling the previously scheduled meeting at the Romanian Parliament was outrageous.","https://english.pravda.ru/world/157880-israel_gate_of_hell/  Crisis in Israel opens the gate of hell in the Middle East and Europe

Intelligence specialist Georgy Rieper believes that the current crisis in Israel marks just another stage of the grand redivision of the world that will trigger other major crises in the Middle East, Europe and Taiwan.

Photo: freepik.com\Liuzishan

""Today, many write clever forecasts about the Samson Option (Israel's use of nuclear weapons) or the full cleansing of Gaza. They switch from Ukraine to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis, but the question is much broader. What we can see now is part of the grandiose redivision of the world that was formed after WWII,"" Georgy Rieper told Pravda.Ru.

Let us recall that Israel today has at least 200 nuclear warheads. The country also has a full-fledged nuclear triad. Israeli nuclear arsenal is believed to be the sixth largest nuclear arsenal in the world.

Officially, Israel never admits to the presence of nuclear weapons. There is only ""no one's nuclear explosion"" known as the Vela incident. However, everyone knows about the Samson Option — Israel's deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons.

A lot has been reported about the existence of so-called ""Parking Plan” when Israel literally wipes Gaza out turning it into one giant parking lot. It appears that Israel is implementing this plan already:

first Gaza is destroyed in massive rocket attacks,

heavy tanks and special forces clear the region,

bulldozers level out the entire territory of the enclave making it look like a parking lot.

""Israel's cleansing of the Gaza Strip will trigger a huge migration crisis and an explosion of aggression in the Islamic world. The United States is bringing an aircraft carrier group in, but who is stopping Iran from transferring anti-ship missiles to Hamas or Hezbollah? Libya may supply old strategic Tu-22 aircraft to Hamas as well. A sunken aircraft carrier is something different than bulldozers in Gaza. The very existence of Israel is at risk. This may lead to the nuclear destruction of the countries of the Arab world,” Georgy Rieper believes.

Migrants (mostly Muslims) will then cause civil-religious and simply civilisational wars in the EU, he also added.

""Believe me, many want to fish in troubled waters and catch benefits when redividing the world. The crisis in Israel has opened the gate of hell in the Middle East and Europe. The whole world will be on fire, blood will drip down the meridians,” he also said.

The expert does not rule out that other major conflicts may occur against the backdrop of such turmoil:

China will launch a military operation to conquer Taiwan;

The Poles will snatch pieces of Ukraine;

India and Pakistan will ""redistribute” Kashmir (which is dangerous, since both countries are nuclear powers);

Japan and North Korea may decide to close their civilisational and territorial disputes;

Northern Cyprus could become another hotspot;

The Serbs and the Albanians will fight over Kosovo;

Ireland will remember its independence and centuries of humiliation from Britain;

If Britain is distracted by Ireland, Argentina may remember ""its” Malvinas Islands.","https://english.pravda.ru/world/157886-romania_zelensky/  Romania slaps Zelensky in the face in public

Intelligence specialist Georgy Rieper believes that the current crisis in Israel marks just another stage of the grand redivision of the world that will trigger other major crises in the Middle East, Europe and Taiwan.

""Today, many write clever forecasts about the Samson Option (Israel's use of nuclear weapons) or the full cleansing of Gaza. They switch from Ukraine to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis, but the question is much broader. What we can see now is part of the grandiose redivision of the world that was formed after WWII,"" Georgy Rieper told Pravda.Ru.

Let us recall that Israel today has at least 200 nuclear warheads. The country also has a full-fledged nuclear triad. Israeli nuclear arsenal is believed to be the sixth largest nuclear arsenal in the world.

Officially, Israel never admits to the presence of nuclear weapons. There is only ""no one's nuclear explosion"" known as the Vela incident. However, everyone knows about the Samson Option — Israel's deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons.

A lot has been reported about the existence of so-called ""Parking Plan” when Israel literally wipes Gaza out turning it into one giant parking lot. It appears that Israel is implementing this plan already:

first Gaza is destroyed in massive rocket attacks,

heavy tanks and special forces clear the region,

bulldozers level out the entire territory of the enclave making it look like a parking lot.

""Israel's cleansing of the Gaza Strip will trigger a huge migration crisis and an explosion of aggression in the Islamic world. The United States is bringing an aircraft carrier group in, but who is stopping Iran from transferring anti-ship missiles to Hamas or Hezbollah? Libya may supply old strategic Tu-22 aircraft to Hamas as well. A sunken aircraft carrier is something different than bulldozers in Gaza. The very existence of Israel is at risk. This may lead to the nuclear destruction of the countries of the Arab world,” Georgy Rieper believes.

Migrants (mostly Muslims) will then cause civil-religious and simply civilisational wars in the EU, he also added.

""Believe me, many want to fish in troubled waters and catch benefits when redividing the world. The crisis in Israel has opened the gate of hell in the Middle East and Europe. The whole world will be on fire, blood will drip down the meridians,” he also said.

The expert does not rule out that other major conflicts may occur against the backdrop of such turmoil:

China will launch a military operation to conquer Taiwan;

The Poles will snatch pieces of Ukraine;

India and Pakistan will ""redistribute” Kashmir (which is dangerous, since both countries are nuclear powers);

Palestinians declare war on Israel again

It was Iran and Qatar (indirectly) that supported Operation Al-Aqsa Storm of the Hamas movement that controls the Gaza Strip, part of Palestine.

Let us recall that Israel opposes the creation of the Arab state of Palestine on the territory that that was the UN assigned to it in 1947. Over the years, Israel has been pursuing the policy of Jewish nationalism creating its own country, killing and oppressing those who wanted to live in the independent Palestine.

The Arabs tried to defend their rights, but in 1967 and 1973 they lost wars and territories to Israel. They managed to keep only two enclaves — the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The UN sees them as Israel-occupied territories, as is East Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine.

The interests of the Palestinians are obvious today but what are the interests of Iran?

Iran and Palestine despise Israel

Iran fiercely despises the Zionist regime and its overseas patron, the US. Suffice it to say that Tehran celebrated the Hamas attacks on Israel with fireworks, whereas members of the Iranian Parliament were chanting: ""Death to America.” Iran still wants to take revenge on imperialists and oppressors for the killing of their leader Qasem Soleimani.

In addition, Iran is happy to see its successes in terms of the activities of pro-Iranian groups in Syria and its strike drone sales to Russia. Undoubtedly, Iran supplied its UAVs to Hamas.

One may assume that the Iranians also trained the Palestinians in the experience of modern warfare, taking into account the war in Syria and Ukraine (PMC Wagner could also be involved in that work). Tehran knows how to conduct proxy wars. The Palestinians have nothing to lose as they live the lives of the oppressed.

Hezbollah more powerful and organized than Hamas

Iran also has its own military force, the Hezbollah movement. It is stationed in the south of Lebanon and has experience in the war in Syria.

Hezbollah boasts precision-guided missiles that may reach any corner of the Israeli territory. In 2021, Hezbollah leader Sayed Hassan Nasrallah said that the group counted 100,000 fighters.

On Sunday morning, Hezbollah shelled three military posts in Israeli-occupied Shebaa territories in southern Lebanon. An IDF radar station was hit.

If Israel invades Gaza, Hezbollah will enter Israel from the north and create a second front. The IDF may not be able to organise defence.

Iran choses the right moment

Iran has an open window of opportunity because sanctions on Iranian oil have been lifted and one may not expect them to be imposed again given the embargo and the price cap on Russian oil. The conflict in the Middle East will only drive oil prices up, which is also beneficial for Iran.

Tehran wants to be the leader in the region. This is a self-sufficient sovereign country that managed to establish relations with Saudi Arabia to usher in the ""post-American era.” Riyadh is also ambitious about implementation of the Vision 2030 reform program that can only be achieved by normalising relations with Iran and Israel.

Iran does not need the latter. After Saudi Arabia suffered a defeat in Yemen, Tehran does not view the Saudis as a strong rival.

Israel will thus again become the common enemy of the Arabs, and Iran wants this to happen too.

Qatar as Palestine's sponsor

As for Qatar, this country is a source of financial support for Hamas. Qatar's Foreign Ministry said that Israel bears sole responsibility for the ongoing escalation due to persistent violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, including the recent repeated incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of Israeli police.""

The US military may abandon the use of M1 Abrams tanks due to the ""vehicle survivability problem” that arose as a result of the fighting in Ukraine, Asia Times reports with reference to US military officials.

Photo: openverse.org

""A US Army study has recommended phasing out the M1 Abrams tank for lighter, smaller, unmanned vehicles, citing survivability concerns in future battlefields that have been made apparent in the Ukraine war,"" the publication says.

The Warzone reported this month that a US Army Science Board study recommended switching from M1 Abrams tanks to new, smaller tanks and unmanned vehicles to achieve superiority on battlefields of the 2040s. The study reportedly highlights the need for a next-generation M1 version equipped with larger caliber guns as well as hypersonic anti-tank missiles.

""The Warzone report mentions that the US Army Science Board predicts that future tanks and armored vehicles will face new threats from advanced anti-tank weapons, drones and AI-aided capabilities. It predicts that the battlefields of the 2040s will see increased use of robotics, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) logistics functions and cyber-attacks on command-and-control facilities,"" the newspaper said.

The M1 Abrams will be less dominant on battlefields of the future, the study says.

""The M1 Abrams requires an extensive logistics train, requiring vast supplies of JP-8 jet fuel and a steady supply of spare parts. While the US can directly supply its tank forces via sealift or airlift, or pre-position fuel and spares in countries such as Japan, the Philippines and Australia, the PLA can use its extensive anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities to prevent US resupply operations or a combination of economic and political pressure to deny the US access to bases and logistics facilities,"" Asia Times says.

The US Army Science Board recommends looking into an opportunity to use a lighter tank based on the M1 with enhanced 130 mm guns, smaller crew, hybrid-electric propulsion system and active protection systems (APS).

Former US Marine Matthew Hoh said that Washington transferred old-style tanks to Ukraine because the US did not want the Russian forces to seize any of the new, upgrade tanks.

Russia may terminate its ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty, Russian President Vladimir Putin said speaking at Valdai Discussion Club.

""The United States signed the international act, document, treaty banning nuclear arms tests, and Russia signed it too. Russia signed and ratified it, but the United States signed but did not ratify,” he said.

Speaking about the possible use of nuclear weapons, Putin said that there was no need to change Russia's military doctrine.

""Do we need to change it? What for? Everything can be changed. I simply don't see the need for this,” Putin said.

Russia's response to nuclear aggression would leave ""no chance of survival for any adversary,"" he said.

""From the moment of detection, the launch of missiles, no matter where it comes from, from anywhere in the world ocean, from any territory, hundreds and hundreds of our missiles will appear in the air in response, and not a single enemy will have a chance of survival,” Putin said.

Russia will respond with a nuclear blow if the enemy uses conventional weapons against it that will jeopardise the very existence of Russia as a state, Putin noted.

Russia is moving towards achieving its goals within the framework of the special military operation, and Russia will achieve them, he said.

""We have our own understanding of how the situation is developing. We understand what we need to do and where. We are calmly moving towards achieving our goals and I am confident that we will achieve them by implementing the tasks that we have set for ourselves,” he said.

Speaking about Ukraine's losses, Putin said that sanitary and irretrievable losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exceeded 90,000 people since June 4. In addition, Ukraine lost 557 tanks and almost 1,900 units of other armoured vehicles of various classes.

The Russian budget is coping and will continue to cope with financing the special military operation.

The 20th annual meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club is taking place in Sochi on October 2-5.

""In the beginning of the 21st century, everyone hoped that states and peoples had learned the lessons from the costly, destructive military-ideological confrontation of the previous century,” Putin said.

According to him, everyone also hoped that mankind had come to realise the harmfulness of such confrontation, as well as the fragility and interconnectedness on our planet.

""Global problems of humanity require joint action and search for collective solutions, whereas selfishness, conceit, and disregard for real challenges will inevitably lead us to a dead end,” Putin continued.

This should have become obvious, but it turned out that this was not the case. No,” he said.

The armed confrontation in Ukraine did not start through Russia's fault. On the contrary, Russia is trying to end it, Putin said.

Russia did not start the so-called war in Ukraine, but it is trying to end it, Putin noted.

""We did not start the so-called war in Ukraine. On the contrary, we are trying to finish it. <…> We have no interest in conquering any additional territories. We still have to explore and develop Siberia, Eastern Siberia and the Far East. This is not a territorial conflict,"" the Russian president said.

""It was not us who staged the coup in Kyiv,” the president also said.

Putin described the 2014 events in Ukraine as bloody and unconstitutional.

The root causes of the escalation between Palestine and Israel lie in the failure to implement a two-state solution, Palestinian envoy to Moscow says; the Kiev regime is worried that the 18-month firehose of Western military aid may now potentially shrink to a trickle; and the Central Bank of Russia is setting the regulatory framework for giving foreign banks access to the digital ruble. These stories topped Tuesday’s newspaper headlines across Russia. Izvestia: What sparked Gaza fight and where Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes from here The root cause of the escalation around the Gaza Strip is Washington’s unwillingness to settle the conflict via the creation of two states, Palestinian Ambassador to Moscow Abdel Hafiz Nofal told Izvestia. That said, Israel believes that ending the war means that it must eliminate Hamas as a military and political entity. The sides have continued to exchange missile strikes for three days in a row. According to the US media, Israel is now preparing to launch a ground operation.

Political scientist Vyacheslav Matuzov also contends that one of the key causes of the current situation in the Middle East is the US’ attempts to undo the work accomplished by the ""quartet,"" the negotiation format launched in 2002 which includes the US, Russia, the UN and EU, and to alter the agenda to suit its own views. ""The Americans took everything under their control while Russia was distracted by Syria, Central Asia and domestic issues. The US unilaterally developed its own plan, which it agreed only with Israel while informing neither the Arab countries, nor Palestine, nor the ""quartet"" about its intentions. The plan was dubbed ""the deal of the century"" without disclosing its contents. It was possible to deduce from some fragmentary statements that the plan involved relocating all Arabs from the West Bank to the East Bank and building a purely Jewish state,"" Matuzov said. According to the political scientist, this plan was ""horrifying"" even for US experts on the Middle East because it did not take into account the real interests of the Arab population. ""All of this, especially given the series of revolutions in the Middle East masterminded by the West, led to the creation of an unstable situation for Israel in the Middle East,"" the expert thinks. Benny Briskin, former aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Izvestia that neither him, nor anybody else sees any means of settling the situation. In his opinion, it cannot be settled until Hamas is destroyed, not as an idea but as an organization and a military force. The expert said that, today, there is an absolute consensus across Israel that there is no use in holding talks and negotiations because that path has failed and Israel is now paying the price. That said, Briskin admits that the failure by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to react in the first hours of the conflict to Hamas’ infiltration of Israeli border areas marked a clear fiasco for Israel as a whole. According to him, it is abundantly clear that this represented a colossal intelligence and operational breakdown in which the IDF failed to dispatch special units to protect civilians who were under attack. The expert stated that, for the first time in Israel’s history, civilians effectively found themselves at the frontline. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Kiev worries lest Western military aid firehose may shrink to trickle Addressing the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky tried to draw parallels between Hamas’ latest attacks on Israel and Russia’s actions in the Ukrainian conflict. The Kiev regime is clearly alarmed that, due to the escalation in Israel, the Ukrainian conflict may now take a back seat for the US and EU, which would impact the future flow of the military aid that is keeping Kiev in the fight. Grounds for such concern are more than abundant and, in the future, the West’s support for Ukraine may well diminish, although it will not disappear altogether, experts told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. They also stress that the current escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict confirms the risks of relying on US mediation, and that the Kiev regime should draw its own conclusions from the unfolding situation.

Such statements by the Ukrainian leader show how little he actually knows about the ins-and-outs of major league politics, political scientist Yelena Suponina told the newspaper. She added that the current situation in the Middle East is quite dangerous and such irresponsible claims as Zelensky’s only add fuel to the fire as well as create more difficulties for Israel, for which Zelensky has such pronounced sympathy. That said, Russia, serving as a mediator in this conflict, is displaying a more restrained and objective stance. ""Over recent years, US representatives have been giving much less attention to the Middle Eastern region than before. As US diplomats told me, they haven’t been spending as much effort on the Middle East as, say, ten years ago. Yet now Washington will have to resume giving its attention [to the region]. And because the resources are not limitless, this has to be done at the expense of other regions. So it won’t be possible to exclusively emphasize Ukraine anymore,"" Suponina said. However, one cannot count on a complete suspension of American aid to Kiev. Yet, Washington’s support will begin to decrease and the US will be forced to seek a viable exit ramp from the Ukrainian conflict. That said, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin drew his own conclusions from the latest events in Israel. In his view, the escalation of the conflict there with attacks by Hamas and the shelling of civilians confirmed the ultimate ineffectiveness of the Israeli security model based on a system of external guarantees. One of the lessons of this situation is already obvious. Israel’s security model, which was put in place in lieu of NATO membership, is not suitable for Kiev. Commenting in a social media post, Klimkin wrote that Ukraine should use this argument in its dialogue with its NATO allies, above all with the Americans. RBC: Central Bank of Russia proposes giving foreign banks access to digital ruble in 2025 The Central Bank of Russia has begun to prepare a normative base for connecting foreign banks to the digital ruble beginning in 2025. Plans call for making the new type of currency accessible to a wide circle of users approximately around that time. The banking regulator has published a draft guideline, under which changes in banks’ accounting plans will be introduced and a special account created for foreign lenders’ holdings of digital rubles. This part of the guideline takes effect on January 1, 2025. Foreign banks may join the digital ruble platform in order to conduct international transactions, thus bypassing the SWIFT international payment system (from which Russian banks have been disconnected due to sanctions), Yaroslav Shitsle, an attorney at Rustam Kurmayev and Partners, said. ""It could be any bank that is ready to conclude an agreement with the Central Bank of Russia. Having its own digital currency is not necessary. The only issue is the economic practicality,"" he said. According to Yekaterina Semerikova at the Skolkovo School of Management, the key goal of engaging foreign banks in digital ruble-based transactions is to ease doing business with Russian companies. ""A digital ruble account will help in conducting transactions that are currently hindered due to the sanctions regimes. Moreover, it could also be useful for those who wish to work with Russian clients because currently there is a limited selection of solutions for those who want to retain international partnerships,"" the expert said. Kommersant: Reduction in Israeli gas output may impact LNG deliveries to EU Israel has decided to temporarily suspend gas extraction at one of its largest gas fields, Tamar, located on the Mediterranean sea shelf not far from the Gaza Strip and within range of Hamas’ missiles. Domestic consumers will continue to receive gas from the Leviathan gas field, the largest in Israel. Suspending production at the Tamar field, which was exporting gas to Egypt, among other customers, may result in a lesser load on Egyptian LNG plants, thus reducing LNG deliveries to Europe in winter. Sergey Kondratyev from the Institute of Energy and Finance Foundation notes that Tamar was not providing significant gas supplies to Egypt, as the Leviathan field is a far more substantial exporter and, thus, its reorientation toward serving the domestic market will create problems. Suspending gas extraction at Tamar, if it leads to reduced exports, will more seriously affect Jordan and, to a lesser extent, Egypt, which may adjust its LNG export plans for 4Q by 30-45%. This may in turn affect supplies to the European market in winter to a certain degree.

Over the weekend, the members of Israel’s Security Council voted to formally declare war on radical Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip. The last time Israel took such a step was exactly 50 years ago during the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War, known as the Yom Kippur War, which triggered the first global fuel crisis. Back then, the West faced a supply embargo by Middle Eastern oil producers, which resulted in a quadrupling of oil prices. The current war comes as Israel’s response to Palestinian missile strikes on southern and central Israel. (According to some reports, 3,000 projectiles broke through Israel’s Iron Dome air defense systems, with dozens of Palestinian fighters swooping over the border on paragliders and trucks. The latest reports say 424 Palestinians were killed and 2,300 were injured during the escalation; over 700 people were killed and over 2,200 were injured in Israel).

""If the conflict grows and risks for vessels arise somewhere in the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices will rise,"" Stanislav Mitrakhovich, leading expert at the Financial University and the National Energy Security Fund, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. ""Also, given any further escalation, the United States may take actions against Iran. The Americans may tighten control over growing Iranian oil exports, a trend they have lately turned a blind eye toward. This may be a game changer and oil prices may grow because of potential US moves,"" the expert surmised.

Thus far, however, the risks appear to be low of the conflict expanding further or, more importantly, that it may involve major oil exporters, according to Artyom Klyukin, an expert at IVA Partners. ""It’s too early to say how this conflict will unfold. It may end within days, as the entire population of Israel may be mobilized, and the country has a very strong army,"" Nikolay Dunayev, vice president of the Opora Russia non-governmental organization (NGO), told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. However, should the conflict escalate to a wider confrontation between the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds, an arc of unrest may stretch from Indonesia to Nigeria, with the confrontation with Israel and its supporters being at the very center of it, he argued. Then those who would dare stand against the Islamic world would regret it greatly, and the Ukraine crisis would look like ""child’s play"" in comparison, he warned.

The European Union would support Vladimir Zelensky as a candidate for re-election if Ukraine actually holds a presidential election next year as scheduled, members of the European Parliament told Izvestia. However, much will depend on the US stance, the politicians argued. Sources familiar with the situation said that, for the time being, Washington also wishes to see Zelensky run for re-election. The incumbent Ukrainian president suits Western leaders as he has been pursuing the policy course that they need, experts stress.

In the summer, the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted to postpone parliamentary elections originally slated for this month after Kiev extended martial law until mid-November. Kiev then proposed putting off the presidential vote, which is scheduled for March 2024, but Zelensky recently said the election may take place even with martial law still in effect. In late August, he also promised to announce his re-election bid, if the vote is green-lighted.

Several members of the European Parliament (MEP) insist that the EU sees no alternative to Zelensky among the current crop of Ukrainian politicians and that Brussels will support him come what may, even with the rise in corruption and authoritarianism under his tenure. ""Signs of criticism are appearing even among Zelensky’s supporters in the European Parliament, as everybody understands only too well that the festering problems of corruption and suppression of the opposition would one day bubble to the surface. But it’s hard for me to imagine the EU supporting any other candidate, judging from how it has been indulging Zelensky’s every whim,"" French MEP Thierry Mariani told Izvestia. ""For the EU, Ukraine means Zelensky, and Zelensky means Ukraine. The West is not interested in having Ukraine portrayed as a divided nation with a split political leadership,"" he added.

However, whether the presidential election in Ukraine next year takes place will depend entirely on Washington, as Europe does not have any real say in the matter, said Croatian MEP Ivan Vilibor Sincic.

Andrey Suzdaltsev, political scientist at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), agrees that there could hardly be any alternative to Ukraine’s incumbent leader in the potential election. ""In essence, Zelensky suits the West <…>. He is a legitimate president who has been trying to meet Western requirements. The West would like to see him re-elected, and therefore Westerners have been insisting that a presidential election should take place, while the appearance of an alternative candidate is unlikely,"" he told Izvestia. Moreover, attempting to remove the Kiev regime through normal procedural means is becoming impossible as it is increasingly turning into a dictatorship in which the security forces play a key role, he concluded.

A delegation of US senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) arrived in Shanghai on October 7. Although China is just one stop on their Asian itinerary, as the senators are also planning to visit South Korea and Japan, this is the first US congressional visit to China since 2019.

Upon his arrival, Schumer said that the United States was ready to compete with China but that Washington was not seeking any conflict. The senator also voiced concerns raised by US businesses working in China, which, he said, have been complaining of unfair treatment by the Chinese authorities. The senior US lawmakers may also discuss human rights, the fight against fentanyl trafficking to the US, and potential areas for bilateral cooperation. The US delegation also expects to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The visiting US senators represent states with varying degrees of economic involvement with China, some of which have a rather strong reliance on Beijing, Vasily Kashin, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), told Vedomosti. The politicians are seeking to demonstrate that they do care about economic opportunities for their home-state constituents, he added, while surmising that one of Schumer’s goals may be to use interparliamentary communications as an alternative avenue for dialogue with China.

The Biden administration is sending a number of messages to Beijing, seeking to show that it does not wish to escalate tensions in bilateral relations any further, says Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute for US and Canadian Studies. Against the backdrop of the developments in Ukraine and the Middle East, the United States may be looking to block China from using this window of opportunity to escalate the conflict around Taiwan, the expert argues. Whether Schumer succeeds in convincing the Chinese that a bad peace is better than a good quarrel remains to be seen, he added. In any case, economically it is now important for Washington to prevent any decline in cheap Chinese imports as this could trigger a recession in the US economy, Vasilyev concluded.

Russia’s latest air defense system, which is capable of not only intercepting aerial threats but also destroying maritime and ground-based targets, has been put into service with the Navy. The use of the Poliment-Redut system against surface targets has been successfully tested, and the air defense system is currently being finalized to hit ground-based targets, Russian Defense Ministry officials told Izvestia. The missiles integrated into this system will replenish the arsenal of Russian corvettes of the 20380 and 20385 projects as well as the 22350 series frigates.

The Poliment-Redut weapon was built on the basis of the S-350 Vityaz air defense system and is designed to intercept aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles. It can fire 9M96E or 9M96E2-1 missiles with a range of up to 50 to 150 km, respectively. The system is also equipped with 9M100 short-range missiles. The missiles can hit targets at altitudes ranging from 5 m to 8 km, moving at speeds of up to 3,600 km/h.

Experts say that this system will significantly strengthen the fire capabilities of modern warships. Back in the Soviet era, weapons for ship-borne air defense systems were initially designed to have the ability to shoot sea-and ground-based targets, so this signals a return to previous tactical traditions, Dmitry Kornev, editor-in-chief of the Militaryrussia website, told Izvestia. According to him, the same system can be used in different circumstances, as it can fire at maritime and ground-based targets, without requiring any major modifications. The Poliment-Redut has simply been upgraded to a normal air defense system that can now be used as a dual-purpose system, the expert explained.

Today, the Russian Navy has nine 20380 series corvettes in service, with two more vessels currently being built for the Pacific Fleet, which should be commissioned with the Navy in 2024 and 2026, respectively. Meanwhile, the corvette Merkury entered service with the Black Sea Fleet in May, and work to build another corvette, the Strogiy, is currently being completed. All these warships were designed with the use of stealth technology. And the 20380 series corvettes have a powerful arsenal of weapons. These include the Uran anti-ship system with the X-35 missile and they are equipped with a universal 100-mm A-190 artillery mount that can fire up to 80 rounds per minute.

In October, Russia may export less wheat than last October, with the volume potentially falling to 3.9 mln metric tons, according to pessimistic forecasts.

A wheat exporter told Kommersant that falling exports may be caused by the need to follow the price recommendations issued by the Russian Agriculture Ministry. ""It has been impossible to sell [grain],"" the exporter said, Sovecon CEO Andrey Sizov points to growing competition from Romania and Poland, too, which have been actively exporting wheat as they have accumulated large stocks of the crop.

Although the latest report by Sovecon showed that exporters’ demand for grain remains low, Sizov sees prerequisites for a higher consumption of Russian wheat. Egypt still has a need for grain, while the country bought small amounts of it at recent tenders, which may spur deferred demand later on, Sizov argues. Also, global wheat prices may have bottomed out already and thus could start to grow again, he added. However, Russia will not be able to compensate for any monthly loss because of limited infrastructure capacities, he stressed.

Meanwhile, as of October 5, Russia has exported 18.2 mln metric tons of grain since the season began, or almost twice as much as a year ago, the Agriculture Ministry told Kommersant, citing customs data that excludes volumes sold to the Eurasian Economic Union. In the past week alone, Russia exported more than 1.8 mln metric tons of grain, while another 28 mln metric tons have been contracted for export throughout the second half of 2023, the ministry added.

TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews","https://tass.com/pressreview/1685731  The international climate has evolved dramatically over the past 19 years, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his keynote speech at the annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, which took place in Sochi on October 2-5. The theme of the club’s 20th anniversary session was ""Fair Multipolarity: How to Ensure Security and Development for Everyone."" Experts told Vedomosti that the civilizational approach is the essential core component of Russia’s evolving ideology.

MOSCOW, October 6. /TASS/. Putin makes the case at Valdai for Russia’s role in building a new, fairer, multipolar world; Turkey is preparing to host an international meeting on achieving a peace settlement to the Ukraine conflict, but Russia’s attendance is up in the air; and the EU is facing internal dissension over the migration issue, thus blocking bloc-wide reform efforts. These stories topped Friday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

The president laid the blame squarely on Western elites for the deterioration in relations with the West, which has led to the showdown over Ukraine. While Russia was lending a hand of support to the beleaguered residents of Donbass, at the same time the Kiev regime ""bombed, shot, and sent in the tanks over the course of nine years.""

The West’s colonialist approach to the rest of the world is unacceptable to Moscow, while Russia sees itself as a distinct civilization, as is set forth in its new foreign policy concept, Putin stressed. The US and its satellites had charted a course toward hegemony from the very start, but Russia understood that such endeavors would fail, he added. However, Putin expressed confidence that this time ""has passed, and our understanding of civilization is now completely different.""

Putin also stated that, while the United States is unlikely to face difficulties in continuing to fund military support for Ukraine, this task may prove a challenge too far for Europe given the continent’s economic difficulties and declining GDP. In contrast, Putin assessed the Russian economy as stable, and said he believes that the country’s financial status enables it to boost spending on defense and national security while also simultaneously maintaining social spending.

The head of the Center for African Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), Andrey Maslov, told Vedomosti that the civilizational approach is the most essential, core component of Russia’s evolving ideology. In his view, understanding and appreciating the varied richness of diverse civilizational codes is a viable alternative to blindly accepting the unipolar system of values and objectives pushed by the US and its allies.

Putin recounted that the US has signed but not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), while Russia has both signed and ratified the key arms control agreement. According to Alexander Ermakov, an expert at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), Putin reiterated that while the US calls on everyone to ratify the CTBT, Washington itself has no intention of following its own advice and leading by example.

Turkey is preparing to host the third international meeting on achieving a peace settlement to the Ukraine conflict, at which the peace plan being promoted by Kiev will be the focal point of discussion. The meeting, according to Bloomberg, will be held at the level of national security advisers in Istanbul before the end of October. For its part, however, Moscow does not recognize Ukraine’s so-called ""peace formula"" and, thus, the key question about the upcoming meeting is whether Russia will participate in it at all, RBC writes.

Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky first presented Ukraine’s peace initiative at the G20 summit in the fall of 2022. It contains ten points, including implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the world order, the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities, and ensuring food, energy and nuclear security.

The fact that it is Turkey that is taking the initiative to organize and host the meeting could potentially lead to an invitation for Russia. ""Turkey has had very strained relations with the European Union lately, especially with individual members, in particular with France. Therefore, whatever can be done to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, even if it is from the ‘let’s just talk’ point of view, is still a big positive, because Turkey could stand to benefit from earning the laurels of a peacemaker. And Turkey really needs these bonuses now, because the country has very strained relations with the European West,"" Yuri Mavashev, director of the Center for the Study of the New Turkey, told RBC.

Controversy over migration matters marred the joint summit of the EU and the European Political Community, which opened in Granada, Spain, thus diverting participants away from the stated agenda of launching EU reforms and laying the groundwork for the European integration of new countries in the bloc, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Poland and Hungary came in staunch opposition to any modifications in EU migration policy, which had the effect of casting doubt upon the very idea of reforming the European Union and, consequently, the admission of new member states.

The summit participants were expected to debate all common urgent concerns that, in one way or another, hampered or aided the strengthening of the EU. The meeting had been intended to give a full airing to the topic of European Union reform that would serve to facilitate the bloc’s further growth. However, after the first day of negotiations in Granada, the debate proved to be difficult as there are still too many contradictory stances between applicants for EU membership and among existing EU member nations themselves.

Those countries receiving a large number of migrants are expected to be entitled to seek financial support from their EU counterparts, but this was precisely the basis of Hungary and Poland’s discontent. On Thursday, it appeared that no compromise could be reached on the migration issue.

""Based on statements made during the Granada meeting, the migration issue may not be the sole impediment to EU enlargement. Thus, Vjosa Osmani, the president of partially recognized Kosovo, proposed that EU sanctions be imposed on Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. This appears to be a new prerequisite put forward by Kosovo for normalizing relations between Pristina and Belgrade. Without this normalization, neither Kosovo nor Serbia would be able to enter into negotiations for EU membership. This is the condition of the European Union, and Brussels is unlikely to back off from it,"" Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

Russian coal companies continue to broaden the area of their exports, with coal starting to arrive in Mexico, Argentina, and Bangladesh in 2023, Vedomosti writes, citing data from analytical company Kpler. Russian enterprises exported 314,000 tons of coal to Mexico, 73,000 tons to Argentina, and 48,000 tons to Bangladesh in January-September 2023.

The Ministry of Energy’s press department told Vedomosti that Russian companies are finding potential new clients ""regardless of their location, within the framework of economic feasibility."" ""The return of Russian coal industry players to Southeast Asian and Latin American markets is purely commercial. If the price climate is favorable, supplies to these and other markets will increase,"" the ministry said.

According to Boris Krasnozhenov, head of securities market analytics at Alfa-Bank, Russian coal exporters are continuing to try new markets after consumers in unfriendly nations reduced or ceased purchases from Russia. According to Krasnozhenov, Russian coal companies have opportunities to increase supply to Mexico, as the country’s coal power generation reaches around 75%, and the Latin American country is a fairly major importer of coal in general.

According to Finam analyst Alexey Kalachev, Mexico consumes approximately 10 mln tons of coal each year, while generating around 6 mln tons. At the same time, according to him, the Mexican market is relatively close to large coal-producing countries, such as the United States (output of around 480 mln tons per year) and Bolivia (around 50 mln tons per year), while the distance between Russia’s Far Eastern ports and the coast of western Mexico is nearly 9,000 km.

The recent escalation in Palestine is unlikely to cause a full-scale clash between Israel and radical Arab organizations, according to experts interviewed by Izvestia. Israeli troops carried out an operation in the West Bank on October 5. According to official data, more than 190 people were injured. There were also casualties on the part of the Israeli security forces.

""The Israeli government bears full and direct responsibility for the consequences of the escalation,"" the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said. Israel's position, in turn, is that the troops are countering the terrorist threat in the region.

Palestinian journalist and former political prisoner Esmat Mansour told Izvestia that the current events show that Israel's policy is based on only one option for interaction with the Palestinians - even greater violence against them. Because of this, the situation is only getting worse, he believes.

""The ultra-right leadership of Israel pursues the most understandable goal - to annex those Palestinian territories that they can. There is the political will and the military potential for this, and there are no restraining mechanisms on the part of the international community. Therefore, as far as possible, Israel will expand its sovereignty into the territory of Palestine,"" Sergey Melkonyan of the Department for the Study of Israel and Jewish Communities at the Institute of Asian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences told Izvestia.

At the same time, Boris Dolgov, researcher at the Center for Arab and Islamic Studies at the Institute of Asian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that the current escalation will not lead to a serious and widespread conflict between Israel and radical Palestinian organizations, mainly because the Arab world is split regarding the Palestinian problem.

TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews","https://tass.com/pressreview/1684765  MOSCOW, October 5. /TASS/. Brussels seeking rhetorical win with talk about talks on Ukraine's EU accession; Azerbaijani President Aliyev cancels trip to Spain for first post-Karabakh operation sit-down with Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan; and OPEC+ members decide to maintain current output levels. These stories topped Thursday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

​​​​​

European Council President Charles Michel acknowledged the possibility that Ukraine could join the EU by 2030. Even if Kiev falls short on meeting the seven conditions set forth by Brussels, the European Union summit in December may announce that it is ready to commence negotiations on Ukraine's entrance to the EU, according to Western media. Experts told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the rhetoric trumpeting Ukraine's potential accession to the EU is mostly a way for the EU leadership to burnish its image. However, it does signal the real possibility that a formal decision to start negotiations on Ukraine's EU membership may be forthcoming soon.

Following the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Kiev on Monday and ahead of the informal EU summit in Granada, Spain, on Friday, Michel made a series of new statements on Ukraine's prospects for EU membership. In an interview with French weekly L’Express, he sought to tamp down fears surrounding Ukraine's possible entry into the European Union, pointing out that the country still faces a major reconstruction effort that must be financed. At the same time, however, he told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that Ukraine could join the EU by 2030.

According to Andrey Sidorov, dean of the World Politics Department at Moscow State University, a country must meet a number of standards to join the EU. Of course, Brussels can change the procedural norms, but this requires the approval of all EU member states, which would be virtually impossible to achieve at the moment.

Statements about Ukraine's prospects for EU membership by Michel and other EU leaders, whose terms expire next year, sound increasingly like empty rhetoric, the expert added. However, it remains crucial for Kiev that the very idea of its future membership in the bloc is somehow validated, since NATO membership for Ukraine was effectively abandoned earlier this year, he noted. Given this background, a formal decision could be announced to start accession negotiations. And, such negotiations could then go through countless rounds, dragging on indefinitely, Sidorov told the newspaper.

On October 5, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev cancelled plans to travel to Granada, Spain, for what were to be his first talks with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan since Baku launched its ""anti-terrorist operation"" in Nagorno-Karabakh. The meeting was also expected to be attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Council President Charles Michel, Vedomosti writes. According to media reports, Baku had insisted that a Turkish official also be allowed to attend the meeting, but France and Germany refused. Azerbaijani state news agency APA reported, citing sources, that uncomplimentary statements by French officials regarding Baku were another factor that prompted to Aliyev to abandon the trip.

According to Arnaud Dubien, director of the French-Russian analytical center Observo, Paris’ Caucasus policy is dictated by pro-Armenian popular sentiment in France. According to him, the country is home to a substantial and prominent Armenian diaspora of 400,000-750,000 people. Dubien added that France’s choice to provide military support to Armenia is also driven by the prevalence of Turkish and Russian influences in the South Caucasus.

According to Stanislav Pritchin, an expert at the Center for Post-Soviet Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), France also feels the need to somehow compensate for its embarrassing policy failures in Africa and other foreign policy areas. ""In this regard, Armenia is the most favorable country for achieving a political PR effect. However, objectively and technically, Paris has little chance of expelling Russia from Armenia,"" the expert added.

At the same time, Pritchin believes that Aliyev’s unwillingness to attend the Granada talks is unlikely to result in Moscow becoming the primary mediator in the process by default. ""Given the deterioration in Armenian-Russian relations, I doubt that Yerevan would agree to Moscow’s mediation in [Armenia] signing off on such fateful decisions. The Western overseers would be equally displeased,"" the expert noted.

Russian airlines boosted passenger transportation on international flights by 33% year on year to 14.6 mln people in January-August 2023, according to data from the Federal Air Transport Agency analyzed by Vedomosti. This is the highest figure for this period since the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Passenger traffic to non-CIS nations surged 46% year on year, while transportation to CIS countries rose by 23%.

In January-August 2019, Russian airlines handled 37 mln passengers on overseas flights, but by 2020 this figure had dropped to 9.6 mln. The passenger flow rebounded somewhat to 12.1 mln people in 2021, but plummeted again to 11 mln passengers in 2022 against the backdrop of the special military operation in Ukraine, anti-Russian sanctions, and the suspension of flights by Russian airlines to unfriendly nations.

Access to international flights was hindered by anti-pandemic measures in 2020-2021 and by sanctions in 2022, which resulted in a shortage of capacity on international routes, the expert added.

Fedor Borisov, senior expert at the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), considers the 13% increase in passenger traffic significant, noting that the pace of domestic airlines is ""quite impressive"" compared to GDP growth rates. ""This year, people can fly to Turkey, Egypt, the UAE and Thailand, and for various reasons, flights to the CIS countries, especially Armenia and Kazakhstan, remain in high demand. In general, we are seeing recovery growth along with market stabilization,"" Borisov said.

The decision by OPEC+ members to maintain current production levels will benefit oil prices and keep them above $90 per barrel in the coming months, experts told Izvestia. On October 4, the OPEC+ monitoring committee urged the cartel to abide by previously accepted agreements. At the same time, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced that Russia would continue to voluntarily reduce supplies to global markets by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) until the end of December 2023. Saudi Arabia also expressed its determination to comply with the agreements.

The current oil price benefits all OPEC+ participants, and the goal now is not to increase the price of oil, but to keep it at the current level, according to Artem Tuzov, Director of the Capital Markets Department at IVA Partners. ""OPEC+ members do not want to sell a large amount of oil at low prices. However, they are ready to work and fill the budgets of countries on the basis of the current ones,"" the analyst said.

According to Finam analyst Oksana Lukicheva, OPEC+’s recent decision to leave the current terms of the deal unchanged indicates a significant level of uncertainty among cartel members about the future state of demand.

In turn, Freedom Finance analyst Vladimir Chernov believes that there are currently no conditions for revising the terms of the OPEC deal, as world oil prices are at levels that are comfortable for all global exporters of ""black gold."" ""At the same time, there is a chance that global oil prices will rise next week. The holiday week in China will end, industrial producers will start working and consumption of oil products will increase along with global demand for them and crude oil for their production,"" the expert added.

​​​​​​

Abkhazia is interested in post-Soviet integration processes, and participating in the Union State, alongside Russia and Belarus, would be in line with Sukhumi’s foreign policy goals, President Aslan Bzhania said in an interview with Izvestia. In addition, the South Caucasus country is ready to expand military and technical cooperation with Russia, including plans for establishing a permanent Black Sea base for the Russian Navy in the country in the future.

""Interaction with Russia is unique for us, there are probably no similar examples, with the exception of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Many things have changed for the better since Russia recognized the independence of the Republic of Abkhazia. The most important thing that we appreciate and would like to emphasize is that peace has been firmly established in Abkhazia,"" he said.

Speaking about Abkhazia’s potential participation in Union State projects, Bzhania noted: ""It is difficult to survive alone in this very unpredictable world, and of course we would like to see our allied relations with Russia strengthened in accordance with our interstate agreements. And the agreement of November 24, 2014 explicitly stipulates that Russia will develop conditions for Abkhazia’s participation in integration processes on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Participation in such an agreement together with Belarus in the future would be a step in the right direction and would benefit Abkhazia’s interests.""

""Much has been achieved in terms of military cooperation with Russia, but there are still many measures to be taken, which we are constantly doing. <...> We have reached an agreement, and the Russian Navy will have a permanent base in the Ochamchira District in the near future,"" Bzhania added.​​​

TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews","https://tass.com/pressreview/1684165  Armenia’s National Assembly (parliament) has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), thus joining the court, which earlier issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova. This marks the most striking step to date, though not the first and certainly not the last, that Yerevan has taken in pursuing a policy of distancing itself from Moscow. The document was ratified shortly before a European Political Community summit, in which Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will also participate, Kommersant writes.

American studies expert Alexander Domrin believes that the Republican-led US House of Representatives (lower house of Congress) may make some adjustments, in particular by demanding an oversight report on how the funds already appropriated have been spent. However, Biden has the opportunity to use his so-called ""residual powers"" to scrape up enough cash to keep the pipeline of support for Kiev flowing. ""The support will continue for as long as Biden remains in office,"" Domrin concluded.

Certain delays in US financial and military assistance to Kiev may occur over the coming six weeks, but the odds are low that the aid spigot will be shut off altogether, Viktor Mizin, researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), pointed out. In the expert’s view, if the next fiscal year’s budget is approved in November, the administration of US President Joe Biden will be able to step up supplies of both weapons and financing for Kiev. ""Ukraine remains a strategic project for the US, in which too much has already been invested, so Washington won’t give it up that easily,"" the analyst said.

On September 30, the US Congress passed a stopgap funding bill for the next 45 days, during which the lawmakers will need to approve a budget for the next fiscal year. While the Democrats had planned to tuck an additional $6.15 bln in aid for Ukraine into the bill, the Republicans blocked the initiative.

The Associated Press confirmed reports that the US is running low on money to replace those weapons that have already been provided to Ukraine, citing a letter that Pentagon Comptroller Michael McCord sent to congressional leaders. According to him, Washington has $5.4 bln left to provide weapons and equipment from its stockpiles.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) has stocks of military materiel worth $5.2 bln still at its disposal to send as aid to Ukraine, Vedomosti writes, citing The Wall Street Journal. This is what remains of the $43.7 bln that Washington has earmarked for security assistance to Kiev since military operations began in February 2022.

MOSCOW, October 4. /TASS/. The US has enough stockpiled weapons remaining to keep feeding Ukraine’s voracious aid appetite until Congress passes a budget for the next fiscal year; Yerevan is downgrading its longstanding allied relations with Moscow; and Washington is seeking to normalize ties with Kabul. These stories topped Wednesday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

The ratification of the ICC’s Rome Statute is not the first move by Yerevan that Moscow has deemed unfriendly. In September, Armenia hosted joint military drills with the United States after refusing to host the Collective Security Treaty Organization’s (CSTO) exercises in January.

""This space is going through changes,"" Sergey Markedonov, senior researcher at the Center for Euro-Atlantic Security at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), noted. ""This also includes the standoff between Israel and Iran, as well as Turkey’s ambitions. Moscow will now pay less attention to the Caucasus as Ukraine is currently a priority. However, Russia has border guards stationed in Armenia and a military base in Gyumri, and [Russian] peacekeepers are also still there. It’s not correct to say that it’s all over. The agenda is just getting more complicated,"" the expert explained.

Armenia’s goal in ratifying the ICC’s Rome Statute is to obtain additional leverage for putting pressure on Azerbaijan on the international stage, Doctor of Law Alexey Ispolinov told Vedomosti. In addition, ratification of the Rome Statute is usually one of the conditions for harmonizing a country’s legal rules with European norms and thus strengthening ties with the European Union.

Azerbaijan is not a party to the Rome Statute and, thus, it would be difficult to apply the ICC’s decisions to Baku, Stanislav Pritchin, an expert at the Center for Post-Soviet Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations, pointed out. Meanwhile, the ICC issue creates a notable problem for Russian-Armenian relations because, by agreeing to accept the court’s decisions, Yerevan has in reality signed on to join a concerted campaign to ramp up pressure against Russia, the expert concluded.

The US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs is engulfed in debate over an old resolution titled Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) overseas, first passed in the early 2000s in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The administration of US President Joe Biden has made no secret of its readiness to remove Afghanistan’s Taliban movement (banned in Russia as a designated terrorist organization) from the list of potential targets under the AUMF, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

The Taliban debate began amid discussions about the advisability of extending the AUMF, which the Biden administration had initially sought to repeal. While some lawmakers would like to preserve the status quo, others are ready to make compromises and revise the old rules. It is difficult to say how the White House’s readiness to take the Taliban off the list of potential targets would affect relations between Washington and Kabul as the two countries have been locked in a lingering confrontation since the chaotic evacuation of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.

Omar Nessar, a researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Asian Studies, pointed out that the US remains a hostile actor for Taliban strategists, at least in the public field. ""In any case, this is how Taliban leaders describe the US,"" the expert noted. ""Still, the Taliban depends on the US financially more than on any other country,"" he added. According to Nessar, Taliban officials do not deny that the diplomatic recognition of the Kabul regime depends entirely on Washington. ""That said, the Taliban are interested in building relations with Washington,"" the expert concluded.

International relations expert Vladimir Frolov noted, in turn, that the viability of the old AUMF had been subject to debate in the US for quite a while. ""The idea has some support among both Democrats and Republicans, for various reasons,"" the analyst said. According to him, the Taliban may be removed from the list of potential targets precisely because the movement is inclined to cooperate with the CIA in the fight against the Afghan branch of the Islamic State.

EU officials in Brussels have issued a list of critical technologies that the European Union views as representing the highest risk in terms of Europe’s dependence on external players and the possibility of their falling into the hands of countries that could use them for military purposes and violating human rights. However, Brussels did not have the courage to openly say that it has China in mind, while the recently presented European Economic Security Strategy is mostly aimed at reducing the risks of cooperation with Beijing, Izvestia writes.

The European Union is not the first to restrict cooperation with China in the high-tech field. The US, which has always been in the sanctions forefront, banned the export of high-performance computing chips, equipment for their production and certain semiconductor technologies to China about a year ago. Beijing considers these practices to be an attempt to suppress its technological development, calling it a deviation from the principles of fair competition and highlighting its right to take reciprocal measures. In particular, China recently restricted the export of rare earth metals Gallium and Germanium as a retaliatory measure.

""China has quite a wide range of retaliation tools. Let’s take the trade war between the US and China: In this case, Beijing introduced export controls in response to US steps and significantly restricted imports and exports to and from the US, redirecting value-added chains to Southeast Asia, Eurasia and Latin America,"" Alexander Korolyov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), noted. There is every reason to believe that, despite trade and economic interconnections between China and the EU, Beijing will respond by restricting the export of critical semiconductors that the Europeans have been actively buying in China, the expert emphasized.

Russian International Affairs Council Program Director Yulia Melnikova believes that, even though China still firmly hopes to improve relations with Europe, it will definitely respond to steps such as potential export controls on technologies. If retaliatory measures are taken, they will most likely target critical rare earth metals that European industries need, particularly for implementing ambitious green transition plans, the analyst concluded.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to Europe have been declining for three consecutive months. Meanwhile, Russian pipeline gas supplies actually remained at the August level in September, Vedomosti writes, citing calculations based on data from gas giant Gazprom and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG).

Experts attribute the drop in LNG exports to the EU to the high level of gas in underground storage facilities. In mid-August, gas stocks exceeded 90% of the total capacity of the facilities, while the EU had planned to reach that level by November 1. Finam Financial Group analyst Sergey Kaufman points out that, in September, the level of gas in underground storage sites reached 100% in some EU countries that are major LNG importers.

Ronald Smith, a senior analyst at BCS World of Investments, expects that LNG imports will start to grow again once the winter heating season kicks off. ""The timing will depend on when the cold weather sets in. The heating season usually begins in the second half of October, but it may be delayed as far as late November,"" he explained.

According to Finam’s forecast, the redirection of LNG exports from the Asian market to the European one will start in November. However, gas supplies will be restored to the record levels recorded in the spring of 2023 only in case of a cold winter in Europe, Kaufman said.

Russian pipeline gas supplies, in his words, are mostly directed towards Central and Southern European countries, which either do not import LNG at all or ""rely on it less."" Smith adds that Russian gas prices in the European market are quite competitive at the moment, while they remained higher than spot rates for most of the first six months of the year.

The St. Petersburg Telegraph Agency (SPTA), the first official news agency of Russia and the predecessor of ITAR-TASS, began to operate on September 1, 1904.

The creation of the agency was initiated by the Finance, Interior and Foreign Ministries. On July 4, 1904 a meeting of representatives of the ministries empowered ""to consider issues concerning the project of a government telegraph agency"" adopted the basic documents for the creation and operation of SPTA.

The project to launch SPTA was approved by last Russian Tsar Nicholas the Second. The agency had to ""report within the Empire and abroad political, financial, economic, trade and other data of public interest"". Three directors, one from each of the Finance, Interior and Foreign Ministries, comprised the panel that managed the agency.

On December 31, 1909 the agency was subordinated directly to the Council of Ministers upon a submission of Prime Minister Petr Stolypin.

Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA)

On August 19, 1914, one day after Nicholas the Second ruled to rename St. Petersburg into Petrograd, SPTA changed its name accordingly and became the Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA).

During the Bolshevik revolution on October 25 (November 7) 1917 the PTA building in Pochtampt Street was seized by revolutionary Baltic Fleet seamen headed by Military Commissar Leonid Stark. The first reports written by Stark about the Bolshevik revolution were immediately wired by PTA to the whole world.

On November 18 (December 1) 1917 the Bolshevik government (Sovnarkom) decreed PTA to become the central government information agency. In March 1918 PTA moved to Moscow where it merged in June with the Press bureau of the government.

Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA)

On September 7, 1918 the government presidium resolved to rename PTA and the Press bureau into the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA).

ROSTA became ""the central information agency of the whole Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic"".

Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)

On July 10, 1925 the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) was founded and took over the main functions of the Russian Telegraph Agency as the central information agency of the country. TASS enjoyed ""exclusive right to gather and distribute information outside the Soviet Union, as well as the right to distribute foreign and domestic information within the Soviet Union, and manage the news agencies of the Soviet republics"". TASS comprised news agencies of all the Soviet republics: RATAU (Ukraine), BELTA (Byelorussia), UZTAG (Uzbekistan), KAZTAG (Kazakhstan), GRUZINFORM (Georgia), AZERINFORM (Azerbaijan), ELTA (Lithuania), ATEM (Moldavia), LATINFORM (Latvia), KIRTAG (Kirghizia), TAJIKTA (Tajikistan), ARMENPRESS (Armenia), TURKMENINFORM (Turkmenia), ETA (Estonia). TASS news and photos were received by 4,000 Soviet newspapers, TV and radio stations and over a thousand foreign media outlets. The news agency ran one of the biggest networks of correspondents in the world - 682 offices in the country and 94 bureaus abroad, and employed close to 2,000 journalists and photo correspondents.

ITAR-TASS

The news agency was named the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (ITAR-TASS) in January 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the proclamation of sovereignty by democratic Russia.



Russian news agency TASS

In September 2014 the agency returned to its former and world-famous name for delivering news to global audiences - simply titled TASS. Rebranding the oldest news agency in Russia is destined to become a symbol of professionalism, enthusiasm, readiness of its team for personal development and the agency’s bid to preserve and develop its best traditions.","https://tass.com/world/1687813  MOSCOW, October 10. /TASS/. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the launch of a large-scale operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while the Palestinian militant group Hamas said it had no plans to negotiate the fate of people it had taken hostage as long as fighting continues.

Meanwhile, Moscow is making efforts to clarify whether there are Russian nationals among the hostages. The Russian Foreign Ministry is also working to evacuate Russians from the conflict zone. According to the Russian embassy, two Russian citizens have been killed in Hamas attacks.

TASS has summarized the key information about the conflict.

Casualties

More than 900 Israelis have been killed and over 2,600 others have been wounded in Hamas attacks. Also, Israel has sustained 123 military casualties since the incursion began, The Times of Israel reported.

According to the latest reports, the clashes and shelling have left more than 780 Palestinians killed, with over 4,000 people being injured. Five Palestinian reporters in Gaza were also killed. The number of people who have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip has risen to 137,000, according to data from the UN.

Combat operations

The IDF is currently conducting a wide-scale strike on targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip. Also, the arsenal and a command outpost had been struck. Sirens sounded again in Beer Sheva and the Negev area.

Also, IDF army aircraft struck the Rafah crossing point on the border with Egypt and Gaza, Al Arabiya reported, citing the Palestinian Interior Ministry.

Hamas official Ali Barakeh told The Associated Press in an interview that, so far, only around 2,000 fighters, out of an army of 40,000, had taken part in the latest fighting in Gaza. The IDF called up 300,000 reservists in a 48-hour-span amid the fighting. In addition, the Israeli Air Force has airlifted hundreds of Israeli troops back from Europe. IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari reported that the IDF had evacuated residents from all settlements adjacent to Gaza and warned that anyone who approaches Israel would be killed. An IDF helicopter destroyed a squad of terrorists who had infiltrated into Israeli territory near Kibbutz Zikim in the country’s south.

Situation in Israel

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that a coordination center be set up to search for missing Israelis following the attack by Hamas fighters.

Shufersal, Israel’s largest retailer, has imposed restrictions on a number of products amid increased demand.

Evacuations of foreigners are ongoing. Thus, Poland has already evacuated more than 600 of its nationals, while Bucharest has evacuated almost 600 Romanian citizens. Italy is evacuating around 200 people, while Kazakhstan has run a flight to evacuate its nationals from Israel.

Third countries threatening to intervene

Israel’s Ambassador to the EU and NATO Haim Regev called on EU countries to make sure Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority stay out of the conflict in an interview with Politico.

Meanwhile, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Brown warned Iran not to get involved in the conflict. The United Arab Emirates has issued a similar warning to Syria, officials told Axios. An Emirati official refused to discuss private diplomatic conversations with Axios.

Israel has so far deployed tens of thousands of troops to the border with Lebanon, anticipating an attack by the military wing of the latter’s powerful armed group Hezbollah. The IDF also scrambled helicopters as it suspected a violation of its airspace near the Golan Heights and the Upper Galilee region, but these reports were never confirmed.

Situation around hostages

Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniye announced that the movement had no plans to engage in talks about the fate of its Israeli hostages until the fighting ends.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was clarifying whether any Russian nationals may be among the hostages. He confirmed that Moscow was keeping in touch with Palestinians.

Earlier, Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouq told Al Jazeera that there were Russian and Chinese nationals among the hostages in Gaza.

Russia’s stance

Peskov said that Russia intended to contribute to finding ways to settle the conflict. Ensuring the security of Russian nationals in the Middle East is Moscow’s priority, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said as he added that the country was currently working on evacuating its citizens.

In turn, commenting on the situation in the Middle East, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that it was the result of a major failure by US intelligence who had failed to warn of a potential escalation between Palestine and Israel beforehand.

Assistance supplies from US

The United States has already rushed military aid to Israel and will soon announce additional funding.

Washington is weighing linking aid to Israel and more funding for Ukraine in order to curry favor with Republican congressmen who oppose additional assistance for Ukraine.

Support for Palestine

Earlier, Neighborhood Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi announced that the European Commission (EC) would immediately put all its development aid for Palestine, worth 691 mln euros, under review. Later, Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said that the EC would provide humanitarian assistance to all Palestinians in need.

European Council President Charles Michel urged continued assistance to Palestine in a phone conversation with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. France and Spain opposed cutting off assistance.

Against the backdrop of the Gaza blockade by Israel, the World Health Organization called for opening a humanitarian corridor ""for critical supplies.""

International response

In a joint telephone call, the leaders of Great Britain, Germany, Italy, the United States and France condemned the actions by Hamas as they expressed their full support for Israel.

Meanwhile, the Human Rights Watch accused both Hamas and Israel of military crimes, criticizing Jerusalem for delivering ""indiscriminate attacks"" and imposing punitive measures on Gaza’s population. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said that Israel’s total blockade of Gaza, which endangers ""the lives of civilians,"" was prohibited under international law.","https://tass.com/politics/1687777  MOSCOW, October 10. /TASS/.
