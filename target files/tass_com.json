The United Nations Security Council will gather on November 9 for an open session on the Middle East conflict settlement, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said.\n\nAccording to her, China, which holds the rotating chair in the UN Security Council this month, intends organizing regularly both formal and informal UNSC sessions regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.\n\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh also stated that all 15 members of the UN Security Council participate in consultations on the Middle East conflict settlement document that was proposed by the organization\u2019s ten non-permanent member states.\n\nLast month, the UN Security Council failed to adopt any of the four draft resolutions on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The ten non-permanent members of the UN Security Council drafted their own document, which is expected to incorporate provisions from previous draft resolutions.\n\nTensions flared up again in the Middle East on October 7 when militants from the Gaza Strip-based Palestinian radical group Hamas staged a surprise incursion into Israeli territory from Gaza. Hamas described its attack as a response to the aggressive actions of Israeli authorities against the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City.\n\nIn response, Israel has announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, and begun delivering air strikes on the enclave and certain parts of Lebanon and Syria. Clashes are underway in the West Bank as well."

        "content": "Underground tunnels and high-density housing complexes remain the main obstacles hindering Israel\u2019s ground forces from advancing in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, Israel announced the launch of stage three of its military action against the radical Palestinian group. In particular, this entails the expansion of ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the enclave. Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip are also continuing, Izvestia writes.\n\nMOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. Israel launches the third stage of its ground operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip; further US financial aid for Ukraine is far from a done deal as the Middle East takes center stage; and two European leaders are visiting Central Asian capitals but pursuing diverse agendas. These stories topped Wednesday\u2019s newspaper headlines across Russia.\n\nThe media reported on October 31 that at least two IDF armored and infantry divisions, numbering about 20,000 troops, have entered the Palestinian enclave since the start of ground operations was announced. The heaviest fighting is underway in northern Gaza; clashes are also taking place in the Strip\u2019s numerous underground tunnels.\n\nAn intricate network of underground tunnels built by Hamas is what is preventing the IDF from launching a full-scale offensive in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian resistance\u2019s military infrastructure is 500 kilometers long. In some places, underground corridors go 70 meters deep, although the average depth does not exceed two meters. According to estimates and data from open sources, the underground city consists of 1,300 corridors.\n\n\"There was a plan to blow up these underground tunnels. Israel tried to do that during its military operation in Gaza back in 2014. In my view, the same method will be employed this time, too, even though its effectiveness is questionable. Some say that there is an entire city hidden under the ground. If this is true, it will be hard, if not impossible, to blow up the entire network,\" said Ivan Bocharov, program coordinator of the Russian International Affairs Council.\n\nIn his opinion, a vicious circle is in play in Gaza because in order to blow up the tunnels, Israel needs to control the situation on the ground. That, in turn, is a difficult military objective to achieve because Hamas militants will take full advantage of the tunnels to stop the IDF from gaining a foothold in the Strip. In addition, the Palestinians use the tunnels not only to hide fighters and commanders, but also to smuggle in supplies from Egypt for their self-made weapons production facilities in Gaza.\n\nMedia: More US financial aid for Ukraine still not done deal as priority shifts to Israel\n\nUS House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson (Republican, Louisiana), elected last week, and a group of his fellow congressional Republicans have presented a bill providing for $14.3 bln worth of military aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US tax authority. The draft legislation will be submitted to the full House on November 1 and may be put to a vote on Thursday, Vedomosti writes.\n\nThe Democrats are not keen on supporting Johnson, but the looming 2024 congressional and presidential elections as well as the rapidly escalating situation in the Middle East may compel them to discuss his initiative, said Viktoria Zhuravlyova, head of the Center for North American Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS). Moreover, the expert stressed that rapid developments in Israel and the Gaza Strip may force the Democrats to put the issue of further aid for Ukraine aside for the time being.\n\nLev Sokolshchik, senior researcher at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), views Johnson\u2019s proposal as part of ongoing political horse-trading between the Democrats and Republicans. He explained that the US is now entering its latest election season in earnest, which is having a radicalizing effect on the agendas of both major political parties. \"It will be hard for the parties to reach a compromise and consequently, [US President Joe] Biden will face increasing difficulties in combining aid packages for Israel and Ukraine. However, further assistance for Ukraine is still an open question and, thus, remains a subject of heated debate and a key bargaining chip both internally within the Republican Party conference in Congress itself as well as between the Democrats and Republicans,\" the analyst concluded.\n\nAmerican studies expert Eduard Lozansky, in turn, told Izvestia that Kiev still could count on US aid, which, however, will be more modest than expected. \"Many [Republican] lawmakers would like to cut off funding [to Kiev]. They believe that it [Ukraine] is a corrupt bottomless pit and, thus, the US is sending huge amounts of money into a black hole, while there are enormous problems [in need of funding] at home. However, I think that they still will allocate a certain amount of funds. In all likelihood, the aid will not hit the $60 bln mark, but is likely to be in the range of $10 bln to $20 bln, for example. I believe that it will come right after the vote on aid for Israel,\" for which there is a bipartisan consensus, Lozansky emphasized.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will visit Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on November 1-2. His goal will be to ensure France\u2019s energy security as the Central Asian countries are rich in uranium, Vedomosti writes, citing Western media reports.\n\nMacron is also said to be seeking to reduce the dependence of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on Moscow. Paris believes that Russia\u2019s special military operation in Ukraine has upset the balance of power in the region, thus opening a window of opportunity that France can attempt to exploit. Macron\u2019s activities are viewed as part of the Group of Seven (G7) nations\u2019 policy aimed at strengthening partnership with Kazakhstan.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will also visit the Kazakh capital of Astana on November 2 to discuss bilateral cooperation with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He will also be an observer at the summit of the Organization of Turkic States, which brings together the leaders of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan are important partners for France and provide over 50% of the EU country\u2019s uranium, said Pavel Timofeev, sector director at the Department for European Political Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS). Given issues with Niger after the coup in that uranium-rich country, it has become critical for Paris to strengthen other supply routes because nuclear power plays a key role in the country\u2019s energy system.\n\nIn political terms, France is putting pressure on the countries of the region, some of which are wavering in their traditionally strong relations with Russia. Still, the energy aspect of the Astana and Tashkent visits is more important for Macron strategically because the circle of countries capable of supplying uranium to France is narrower than that of those capable of helping Russia circumvent Western sanctions, Timofeev pointed out.\n\nAs for the Hungarians, they plan to continue to cooperate with Russia in the field of nuclear fuel because it is very difficult technically to change suppliers, Kirill Temetsky, an expert with the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), noted. At this point, the Kazakhstan-hosted Organization of Turkic States summit is more important for Orban as the event is in line with Budapest\u2019s multi-directional foreign policy, particularly its ties to the Turkic world. The platform also offers opportunities for Hungary to boost economic and other ties with Astana, the expert explained.\n\nRussia\u2019s share of the global market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) may grow to 30% by 2035, First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said at the St. Petersburg International Gas Forum on October 31, Vedomosti notes.\n\nAccording to Russia\u2019s 2035 energy strategy, the country\u2019s LNG production is expected to reach 100 mln metric tons by 2030, growing to 140 mln tons by 2035. The International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL) says that Russia\u2019s share of global LNG exports stood at 8.2% in 2022. The country was in fourth place, following Qatar, which had a 20.3% share of the market, Australia (20.2%) and the United States (19.4%).\n\nThe long-term development program for Russia\u2019s LNG production, adopted in March 2021, stipulates that about 20 large-and medium-capacity plants will operate in the country to allow Russia to boost production up to 140 mln tons by 2035.\n\nIn order to increase its share of the global LNG market to 30%, Russia needs to boost annual production to at least 180 mln tons, Finam analyst Sergey Kaufman estimates. In his view, it would be more realistic to expect Russia\u2019s share to grow to 20-23%.\n\nHowever, Maria Belova, research director at the Implementa company, argues that the Russian Energy Ministry\u2019s plans to capture 30% of the market \"don\u2019t look like an unachievable goal.\" Today, LNG projects with a total annual capacity of up to 230 mln tons are at different stages of implementation in Russia, she explained.\n\nAccording to Kaufman, Russian companies can direct additional exports to China, India and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Belova specified that Russian LNG projects are competitive enough to claim access \"to any markets not limited by sanctions.\"\n\nThe wind power industry has been caught in a financial storm, Western media outlets report. The sector used to be profitable when interest rates were low and government support was high, but as interest rates went up, Western wind power companies quickly found themselves insolvent. Meanwhile, China continues to produce wind turbines and, now, Chinese companies are producing 60% of wind energy worldwide, Nezavisimaya Gazeta notes.\n\nProblems in the wind power sector have been piling up for several years. Key issues include accelerated inflation and a rise in interest rates. Long-term projects are facing increasing labor and equipment costs, as well as supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn the meantime, China is becoming the dominant player in terms of global wind energy production. The overall capacity of China\u2019s onshore and offshore wind installations doubled in 2022 compared to 2017. It currently exceeds 310 gigawatts, which is roughly equivalent to the total capacity of the world\u2019s top seven wind power producing countries.\n\nIn Russia, the installed capacity of wind power plants rose 1.1-fold in 2022 compared to 2021, according to experts from the Russian Association of Wind Power Industry (RAWI). A total of 75 wind power plants were installed in 2022, and another 325 are at different stages of construction.\n\n\"The wind energy sector in Western countries is developing through subsidies. The intent is to replace energy generation based on imported resources with local resources. The goal of such [wind power] construction projects was not to make money and achieve high profitability but to receive subsidies. In Russia, the wind power industry is based on the principle of cost recovery. No one launches projects in areas where they do not necessarily make economic sense. On the contrary, economic actors choose places where the highest possible profitability can be achieved. In particular, those include Russia\u2019s remote regions where the government subsidizes fuel deliveries. The cost of wind and solar energy is significantly lower there than that derived from fuel oil and coal, which have to be brought to those areas,\" Iva Partners department director Artyom Tuzov pointed out.\n\nTASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews"

        "published_date": null,
        "content": "MOSCOW, October 31. /TASS/. Russian officials and experts see Ukrainian fingerprints all over the Dagestan airport riot; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to escalate tensions with Israel and the West over Gaza, at least rhetorically; and Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and the Pentagon\u2019s top China official are both attending a key Beijing security forum. These stories topped Tuesday\u2019s newspaper headlines across Russia. Media: Russian officials, experts see Ukrainian fingerprints all over Dagestan riot A police officer who was hurt in the riot on October 29 at the Makhachkala airport in the southern Dagestan Region of Russia is in grave condition at a local hospital now, Izvestia has learned. Earlier, law enforcement agencies detained 83 protesters, and a criminal probe into the organizers of the riot has been launched. Dagestan head Sergey Melikov said a Telegram channel that is managed from Ukraine played the key role in instigating the riot, which was discussed at an emergency meeting chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin last evening.\n\nRead also Russian diplomat says Kiev regime played key role in Dagestani airport incident\n\nThe October 29 riot was organized according to the classic \"color revolution\" playbook, with participants being encouraged to take to the streets together with their entire families \"so that law enforcement agents couldn\u2019t arrest them,\" Igor Ashmanov, a member of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, told Izvestia. In an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Alexey Makarkin, vice president of the Center for Political Technologies, blamed the situation on a combination of external and domestic factors, noting that the disorder could well have been instigated from the outside given the widespread nature of Internet access. He doubts the government will let the issue go, as a certain red line was crossed, he said, referring to the seizure of a critical state-owned infrastructure facility - the Makhachkala airport. As well, the government will need to make an example of the perpetrators as a lesson to others that such behavior is unacceptable, he added. Aleksey Mukhin, director general of the Center for Political Information, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that Ukrainian intelligence operatives and their Western handlers were behind the incident. \"They used \u2018sleeper\u2019 agents already inside the country to destabilize the situation, which is why important infrastructure was occupied,\" he said. According to Mukhin, the detainees will be vigorously prosecuted. \"It\u2019s an explosive situation, and so our security officials and intelligence agencies will be handling it,\" he concluded. Izvestia: Why Turkey\u2019s Erdogan seeks escalation with West over Gaza A massive pro-Palestinian rally held at Istanbul airport last weekend showed widespread support for Palestine within Turkey, with about 1.5 mln people taking part, according to official reports, giving President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an audience eager to hear his fiery speech demonstrating a willingness to raise tensions against Israel and the West, at least rhetorically.\n\nRead also Turkey to declare Israel a war criminal \u2014 Erdogan\n\nThe Turkish leader described the latest actions by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza Strip, where on October 27 the Israeli military launched a wider offensive against radical Palestinian group Hamas, as a massacre. He said that Israel was \"an occupier and a [criminal] gang rather than a state.\" Erdogan laid the ultimate blame for the developments in the Palestinian enclave on the West, accusing it of hypocrisy, as he pointed to the sharp contrast in how European countries reacted to the situation in Ukraine and to similar events in Gaza. Against this backdrop, he cancelled his trip to Israel, although the itinerary had already been pre-arranged. And Tel Aviv moved to recall its diplomats from Turkey and expel the Turkish diplomatic mission to Israel in the wake of the Istanbul rally. However, Erdogan is unlikely to take any specific steps, despite his heated rhetoric on Israel, said Boris Dolgov, lead researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Asian Studies. According to him, Erdogan is seeking to strengthen his position as an opinion leader in the Muslim world, which could potentially become a source of security for Palestine in the future. The expert does not expect Erdogan to escalate things radically in his relationship with the West, despite his rather tough, pointed criticism. While Turkey is unlikely to make any radical changes in the current configuration of its foreign relations, Erdogan could still cause some pain for the West amid the ongoing developments in Palestine, Yelena Suponina, an expert in Asian and Islamic studies, told Izvestia. \"I think this may affect such spheres as Turkey\u2019s partnership with its NATO allies, including as regards Sweden\u2019s membership bid,\" she surmised. Vedomosti: Russian defense minister, Pentagon official both attend Beijing security forum Delegations from more than 90 countries are attending the 10th Xiangshan Forum, running in Beijing on October 29-31. On the sidelines of the event, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu held talks with Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission. The commission is chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Meanwhile, the position of China\u2019s top defense official has remained vacant since October 24, when Beijing dismissed General Li Shangfu as defense minister. In his keynote speech, Zhang pledged efforts to enhance China\u2019s strategic cooperation and coordination with Russia, while his rhetoric on the United States was somewhat ambiguous. In turn, addressing the forum, Shoigu said that the West may provoke a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers by continuing to supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. He also said Russia was set to continue military and defense cooperation with interested partners in the Asia-Pacific region."

        "published_date": null,
        "content": "MOSCOW, October 30. /TASS/. Various factors are restraining Israel from launching a large-scale ground operation in the Gaza Strip; Kiev is continuing to flog Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky\u2019s \"peace formula;\" but the Global South is skeptical; and presidents Biden and Xi will meet in San Francisco but the chances are slim for any major Chinese-US agreement. These stories topped Monday\u2019s newspaper headlines across Russia. Izvestia: What to expect from expansion of Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza Ground battles between Israeli troops and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip have been raging for several days but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have not yet launched a full-scale intervention in the enclave, Izvestia writes.\n\nRead also Israeli army expands ground operations in Gaza, hits 600 Hamas targets\n\n\"There currently are two approaches to a potential ground operation. Under the first scenario, Israel will take control of the northern part of the enclave, protecting it from Hamas and creating a security buffer. The second scenario calls for taking full control of the Strip to mop up all infrastructure facilities of Hamas and other organizations,\" Sergey Melkonyan, a researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Asian Studies, explained. According to him, Israel will not succeed in carrying out a quick operation given that most of Gaza is interlaced with a maze of underground tunnels and that the approaches to the Strip are heavily mined. There are several factors that make it difficult to say whether Israel will dare to launch a full-scale ground operation. First, it may well result in heavy losses for the IDF, which in turn would harm Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s political ambitions. \"The public is pressuring the prime minister to step down because Bibi [Netanyahu] has traditionally sold himself as a political figure who takes Israel\u2019s national security very seriously but his carefully cultivated image as a security hawk is now being seriously tested by this gravest of crises. And, thus far, Israel seems unable to deal with this challenge. It\u2019s difficult to say if the pressure will lead to his resignation. Most likely it will not as he has already made concessions by establishing a united anti-crisis government that actually includes his opponents,\" Melkonyan added. \"Israel has already lost 1,400 people. These are the highest losses the country has ever suffered in a conflict with the Arab world. They want to keep their soldiers safe, which is why Israel is not taking chances,\" military expert Viktor Litovkin said. In addition, a larger-scale operation could also result in the death of the hostages who are being held by Hamas. Vedomosti: Kiev keeps selling Zelensky\u2019s 'peace formula' but Global South not quick to buy Diplomats from 66 countries held a meeting in Malta, initiated by Western countries and Kiev, devoted to discussing Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenksy\u2019s \"peace formula.\" Moscow rejected the original initiative last year and, so, the third such meeting once again proceeded without any input from Russia\u2019s representatives, Vedomosti notes. The consultations involved officials from the European Union and some countries in the Global South, which is the primary target audience for the initiative. The first two meetings took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on June 24 and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on August 5-6. Participants in the Copenhagen consultations included, in particular, members of the BRICS, except for China and Russia, while China, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which attended the Jeddah meeting, refrained from taking part in the Malta event. At each meeting, Kiev presented its 10-point \"peace formula,\" which includes the withdrawal of Russian troops beyond Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders and steps to ensure energy security, among other things. It remains a priority for Kiev to engage various international actors in efforts to promote its vision of a solution to the conflict, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, pointed out. As for the participation of Russia-friendly countries, such as India and China, in such meetings, they only attend those negotiation sessions in which they have an interest, but there are no real grounds to say that either New Delhi or Beijing is being drawn into the camp of those supporting Zelensky\u2019s \"peace formula,\" the expert emphasized. Asian and African countries are well aware of what is going on in Ukraine, and so they \"in no way accept\" the so-called Zelensky formula, Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said. For Zelensky himself, such events represent an attempt to obtain the collective imprimatur of Russia-unfriendly countries, which in turn serves as a lifeline helping him hold on to power in Kiev. To achieve this goal, he needs to share his political plans with non-Western countries. However, Russia\u2019s policy outreach has been far more globally oriented than Ukraine\u2019s, including across the Global South, the expert noted. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Biden, Xi to meet at APEC but no major Chinese-US agreements in sight The leaders of China and the US have agreed to hold a meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco on November 11-17. This is the outcome of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s Washington talks with US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. However, the road to the summit will not be easy because the US has not given up on the strategy of putting pressure on China as a means of preserving its receding hegemony, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes."

        "content": "CAIRO, November 5 /TASS/. At least fifty-one individuals were killed as a result of an Israeli air strike against the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central part of the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian news agency Wafa said.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force attacked a residential building in the refugee camp on Saturday evening, Wafa informed. Women and children make up the majority of victims, the news agency noted. Information was also received about dozens of victims, with many of them still under rubble.\n\nStrikes were also delivered against residential quarters in the north and the west of the Palestinian enclave, apart from the Al-Maghazi camp.\n\nTensions flared up in the Middle East after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip attacked Israeli territory on October 7, when many Israelis living in the settlements near the border were killed and more than 200 people, including children, women and the elderly, were taken hostage. Hamas views its attack as a response to Israeli authorities\u2019 steps against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Israel declared a total blockade of the Gaza Strip and launched bombardments of the enclave and some areas in Lebanon and Syria."
