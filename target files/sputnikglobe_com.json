However, those advantages don\u2019t necessarily translate to other theaters of battle, such Ukraine.\n\n2023-10-10T19:09+0000\n\n2023-10-10T19:09+0000\n\n2023-10-10T19:09+0000\n\nanalysis\n\nukraine\n\nisrael\n\nhamas\n\nmerkava tank\n\nsergei suvorov\n\n/html/head/meta[@name='og:title']/@content /html/head/meta[@name='og:description']/@content\n\nhttps://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/101637/83/1016378340_0:0:1301:731_1920x0_80_0_0_3de3ffc8aa665a2242307a8cab51c1b5.jpg\n\nIn its recent counteroffensive launched over the weekend, the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas caught Israeli forces by surprise, destroying numerous military outposts and temporarily seizing control of a territory twice the size of the Gaza Strip.Amid the attack, the group reportdely managed to destroy some six Merkava IV (\u201cChariot\u201d in Hebrew) tanks using drones. They captured another 14.The main combat tank was recently in the news after Ukraine attempted to procure some for use against Russian forces, alongside armor obtained from NATO countries. Ultimately, Tel Aviv refused the request, as it has refused to sell or donate to Kiev any type of weaponry, including the Iron Dome air defense system.Sputnik spoke with Sergey Suvorov, a retired Russian Army colonel and expert on tanks, to learn about the strengths of the Merkava IV that Kiev wanted to wield, and the weaknesses that made Hamas able to destroy them so easily.\u201cThis is not the first one to burn,\u201d he noted, pointing out that Palestinians had managed to destroy some not long after they entered service.\u201cThe vehicle is good. At one time, Israeli tank crews asked my opinion about this tank. I honestly told them that for a country where there are no swamps, where there are no rivers, and which one can cross using only one gas station, it is impossible to come up with a better tank,\u201d Suvorov said.However, the expert noted that if the tank were instead being used in wide, riparian Ukraine, \u201cin five minutes we would start pulling them out from somewhere.\u201dWhile Ukraine wasn\u2019t able to secure any Merkavas from Israel, it did manage to get armor from several other Western nations, including German Leopard tanks, British Challenger tanks, and American Abrams tanks.Survivability is SupremeIn comparing them to the Merkava, Suvorov noted that the Israelis designed their own armor in the 1970s because of their unique priorities. At the time, Israel was engaging in regular wars with its Arab neighbors, including Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt, which together severely outnumbered the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\u201cWhen they were developing the first Merkava, General Tal, the main ideologist for the development of this tank, prioritized increasing the survivability of the crew in a combat situation and the survivability of the vehicle itself,\u201d Suvorov explained.\u201cThere's a good gun there, they modified it - it\u2019s a German cannon, Rheinmetall\u2019s - but with Israeli modifications, changes were made to the design in order to install it in this turret. There are a lot of different features to protect ammunition from fire, and a good fire control system,\u201d he said.\u201cAs the Israeli tank crews themselves told me, including those who participated in the development of this tank, they used a lot of interesting solutions specifically to increase survivability. That is, if something somewhere could explode, then the design was made in such a way that the explosion was directed somewhere, but not towards the crew, for example,\u201d Suvorov told Sputnik.\u201cAmmunition is stored in separate special containers made of fiberglass or some kind of plastic. I don\u2019t know exactly what material, but they are closed - that is, even if there is some kind of open flame getting inside, then due to the fact that they are closed, they will not ignite.\u201dWhen it comes to disadvantages, Suvorov noted that \u201cthe mass is large,\u201d but added that \u201cfor the area where it is used, this is not the biggest disadvantage.\u201d\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20231010/how-big-is-israels-army-1114068563.html\n\nukraine\n\nisrael\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n2023\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nNews\n\nen_EN\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n1920 1080 true\n\n1920 1440 true\n\n1920 1920 true\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nmerkava tank; hamas; al-aqsa flood; ukraine; israeli tank"

Concurrent with the operation was a massive rocket bombardment targeting half a dozen Israeli cities that overwhelmed Israel\u2019s air defense systems, including the vaunted Iron Dome.As of Tuesday evening, the death toll on the Israeli side had reached more than 1,000. A massive air assault on Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas for good, had killed at least 830 people, according to Palestinian authorities, and Israel had severed all electricity, water, and gas connections to the territory with a population of 1.9 million.Eylon Levy, the former international spokesperson for former Israeli President Isaac Hertzog, told Radio Sputnik\u2019s Fault Lines on Tuesday that the shocking nature of Hamas\u2019 attack had managed to accomplish what seemed impossible just a week ago: to unite all of Israeli society behind the Netanyahu government.\u201cWe're talking about an attack that is simply by the death toll of the people we\u2019ve found seven times worse than the 2015 attacks in Paris, 41 times the death toll of the attack at the Manchester Arena in the UK. And as I say, we haven't found the dead yet. The scale of this is simply incomprehensible. There are still bodies that haven't been collected, much less identified or even buried.\u201d\u201cInstead, what Israel found is, that was a ruse. It was a deception. Hamas had no interest in improving the humanitarian conditions in the economy for the poor people of the Gaza Strip. It simply wanted to distract Israel while it could plan what is not only one of the worst terror attacks in world history, but for your listeners, it's important to understand the single worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Now Hamas is going to rain destruction on the Gaza Strip because Israel has decided the gloves are off, Israel is going to take all the action that it needs to eradicate Hamas.\u201dLevy compared Hamas to Daesh*, saying that Israel \u201cis going to destroy Hamas in exactly the same way\u201d as the international coalition that joined forces against the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2015 through 2018. He said the impending destruction in the Gaza Strip was \u201centirely the fault of the jihadist organization that decided to use it as a base to commit crimes against humanity and atrocities.\u201dMuch of the last year, following the election of a right-wing coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has seen political divisions widen inside of Israeli society. Mass demonstrations against judicial reforms that critics said would weaken the government\u2019s checks-and-balances system rocked Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other Israeli cities, and a criminal case against Netanyahu for alleged corruption has continued to slowly proceed.However, Levy told Sputnik that following the Hamas attacks over the weekend, \u201cat the moment, Israel is not in a civil war at all - Israeli society is united.\u201d\u201cIsrael's goal is that by the end of this war, Hamas will exist no longer as a military organization capable of posing any threat to Israel,\u201d Levy added.\u201cIsrael is very grateful for the huge American aircraft carrier that is on its way to Israel right now to send a very clear message to Hezbollah, to Iran, to all of their supporters that nobody messes with Israel. And it's been very reassuring that so much of the enlightened world has clearly recognized that and come to Israel's defense. We've seen the houses of parliament in the UK, the Eiffel Tower in France, the White House, the Empire State Building, Sydney Opera House, all lit up in the colors of the Israeli flag,\u201d he said, noting that on Monday, there had been \u201ca very important joint statement from the UK, the US, Italy, Germany and France committing themselves to supporting Israel's acts of self-defense.\u201d*Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist organization outlawed in Russia and many other states.\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20231009/at-least-11-americans-killed-in-hamas-attacks-in-israel-1114051995.html\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20231010/biden-says-us-will-make-sure-israel-has-everything-it-needs-to-respond-to-hamas-attacks-1114075932.html\n\nisrael\n\ngaza strip\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n2023\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nNews\n\nen_EN\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n1920 1080 true\n\n1920 1440 true\n\n1920 1920 true\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nFantine Gardinier\n\nhamas; netanyahu; israel; eylon levy; gaza"

He then died in jail from kidney failure just a month after his arrest. When no one had claimed his body he was taken to the Theo C. Auman Funeral Home.Shortly after his death in 1895, his body was embalmed by a mortician who was experimenting with a new technique he had found in a German medical journal on how to preserve meat.Testing showed the mortician used high levels of formalin, cyanide and arsenic. After appealing to state authorities, the funeral home was allowed to keep his body in order to monitor any rates of decomposition.Following the embalming process, Murphy\u2019s body \u201cbecame hard as wood,\u201d Blankenbiller said of the mummy who wound up dressed in a tuxedo from the 1890s.Murphy\u2019s burial had been put on hold after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. But before the funeral home could bury him, they also had to do some detective work in order to figure out his true identity, which had sat behind the mask of a macabre roadside attraction in Reading for 128 years.\u201cHe\u2019s been gawked at enough,\u201d said Blankenbiller. \u201cWe don\u2019t refer to him as a mummy. We refer to him as our friend Willie. He has just become such an icon, such a storied part of not only Reading\u2019s past but certainly its present.\u201d\u201cAs much as we\u2019re sad about it, we really feel we honored him in the way that he deserved after all of this time.\u201dStrangely enough, some residents of Reading do view Murphy as a symbol of their town and its history, despite the fact the corpse belonged to a New Yorker.Murphy was finally laid to rest in his tuxedo, as well as a bow tie and red sash. He was buried beneath a tombstone engraved with both of his names: the one given to him when he was alive, and the one given to him in death.\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n2023\n\nMary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpg\n\nMary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpg\n\nNews\n\nen_EN\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n1920 1080 true\n\n1920 1440 true\n\n1920 1920 true\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nMary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpg\n\nmummy, pennsylvania, scary, spooky, death, macabre, corpse, burial, science, history, us history"
